-------------------------------
[paragraph]
Last year I started a spreadsheet where I scored and wrote a small blurb about every day of my life. It really wasn't
much of a hassle to do, and it gave me some fun insights into trends over the year. I really don't think it's a great 
tool for improving or shaping my life in any way, but, I do think it's fun. I documented 
[link]2024 in a blog post,https://oysterhey.com/#/writing/daily-data[link], and I'm doing the same this year.

[subtitle]The change from last year

[paragraph]
I slightly changed my scoring system from last year. The main difference was that I aimed for a five (5) 
be an absolutely average day. In some rating systems, a 4/10 would be considered awful. 
But in mine, a four is just a slightly bad day. As follows:

[dotlist]
[b]1-3[b]: Very bad days. Whatever happened on a three or lower really affected me and made me upset.
[b]4-6[b]: Pretty plain days. As much as I want something really exciting to happen to me every day, most days are pretty normal and small things push to either side of five.
[b]7-8[b]: Good days! Usually not something that really stands out more than that day, but I ended the day in a really good mood.
[b]9-10[b]: Fantastic days. These are the ones that I'll remember for years to come.

[subtitle] Main figures
[dotlist]
Average Rating: ............ [b]6.17[b]
Median Rating: .............. [b]6[b]
Mode Rating: .................. [b]7[b]
Standard Deviation: ... [b]1.46[b]

[paragraph]Interestingly, compared to last year, this year was much less up and down. I think that's mostly because I took a lot of
new and exciting vacations last year, and so every couple months there was a big spike. Also like last year, the year
slowly got better over time. I think this is mostly due to the majority of the sad winter months being at the beginning of the year. 
Also, my partner was studying abroad for the first few months of the year.

My worst days changed from Wednesdays to Thursdays this year!

Just like last year, the highlights of my year are always the vacations

[subtitle] Tottenham

[paragraph] My beloved soccer team, Tottenham Hotspur, had a rough year to say the least. Even though they
won their first major title in 17 years, the calendar year was largely an embarrassment. They almost got relegated
in the 2024/2025 season, and the 2025/2026 season has not started much better. The results of this can be 
clearly shown in the data.

[paragraph] It really says something when the thing you've been looking forward to all week - your favorite
sports team playing - has a [i]lower[i] average score than a typical day.

[subtitle]Words
[paragraph]
I wrote a new python script this year to look at the average ratings of days based on specific words that were mentioned.
Several of my friends show up more than ten times in the data, but I removed them from this graph.

[paragraph] I think it's funny how food motivated I am. Three out of the top five words are food-related. Somehow,
I'm not surprised in the slightest. I was also sick SO many times this year, and I'm glad that shows up in the data as
a consistent reason why my days were bad.

How capitalist of me

[subtitle] Takeaways

[paragraph] As mentioned before, I don't think there's much value in taking this type of thing too seriously. I mostly do
it for fun. But, if I had to draw any sort of conclusion, it's that I should try to be less reliant on big vacations
to consistently improve my days. The highs from my vacations this year were a little lower than last year, and I think
that is telling me that I should look for more close-to-home things to excite me in 2026.

[paragraph] Thanks for reading!
