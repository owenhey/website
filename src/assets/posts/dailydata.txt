-------------------------------
[paragraph] Every day last year, as a task of introspection and because I was interested in the eventual graph,
I decided to score my happiness / quality of day and write a quick blurb. I exported the data, fed it into Python, and 
graphed it using [link]Plotly,https://plotly.com/[link].

[subtitle] A note:
[paragraph] The scale: I ranked every day from 1 to 10, but there's
some nuance to what each score means.
[dotlist]
[b]1-3[b]: These are really bad days, anything below a three is already actively very bad, and a one is catestrophically bad.
[b]4-5[b]: I'm not super happy with these days, but nothing really bad happened on them. Often disappointing, but not devastating.
[b]6-7[b]: These days are average. 6s are generally "fine" days where I was a little bored, 7s are "fine" days where I wasn't.
[b]8-10[b]: These are actively good days. Something special happened that made me enjoy them more than an average day.

[subtitle] Core of the data
[dotlist]
Average Rating: ............ [b]7.18[b]
Median Rating: .............. [b]7[b]
Mode Rating: .................. [b]7[b]
Standard Deviation: ... [b]1.15[b]

I was generally happier in the middle of the year.

Overall a pretty good year!

Major events

[paragraph] I think the main takeaway here is that, as you would expect, warm weather and vacations are nice. 
I was expecting a little more deviation across the year (the 10-day average hides that a little), but overall
I was happier when it was warm and when exciting things were happening around me, and not as happy otherwise.

Wednesdays were the worst day, Saturdays were the best

[paragraph] Also, as you would expect, I was generally happier on the weekends and less happy in the middle of the week.

[title] Fun trends
[paragraph] Writing a blurb about each day down allows me to look at trends for
various keywords throughout the year.

[subtitle] My Partner
[paragraph] I started seeing someone around the middle of March. We're still together now, and she's been a 
really positive part of my life. Here's how that looks in the data:

[image]/src/assets/jpg/partner.jpg
She was mentioned in 70 different days

[paragraph] Clearly, she has been a very consistently good part of my life. Other stats about her:
[dotlist]
Her improving my day is [b]statistically significant[b], with a p-value of [b].02[b].
She was involved in all three of my 10-rated days

[subtitle] Tottenham
[paragraph] The other easily trackable trend from my blurbs is Tottenham Hotspur, the soccer team
I support. Here are some graphs about that:

[image]/src/assets/jpg/tottenham.jpg
Tottenham winning was a key factor in my happiness

Some days where Tottenham won still got low scores, and vice-versa

[paragraph] Something worth noting here is that in my time-zone, Tottenham usually plays in the morning.
I would almost always rank the days at night before bed, and so its possible some of their effect would be lost
due to lack of immediacy.

[subtitle] Comparisons
[paragraph] And for fun (and to potentially incriminate myself), let's compare how "important" 
Tottenham is to my happiness per-day versus my partner.

[image]/src/assets/jpg/differentcomparisons.jpg
Not a great look for me...

[paragraph] At first, it seems like Tottenham winning has more of an effect on my happiness than her, but 
looking at p-values:
[dotlist]
Does mentioning my partner lead to better days? p-value: [b].02[b]
Does Tottenham winning lead to better days? p-value: [b].035[b]

[paragraph] Both are statistically significant, but I'd put my faith in the former in this case.

[paragraph] Thank you for reading! I hope to do this next year â€“ I want to take better
notes of what happened, and be more rigorous about what each rating means.
