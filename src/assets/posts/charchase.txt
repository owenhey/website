[paragraph] [link]Char Chase,https://oysterhey.itch.io/char-chase[link] was the first game jam I ever participated in, and I am SO glad that I did. It was over a weekend
in October for Ludum Dare 56. I worked alone, and made everything during that time save for the music.

[subtitle] Goals
[dotlist]
Keep the scope small - this was my first game jam, and I wanted to make sure I was able to submit something complete and polished.
Make something easy to pick up - I wanted to be able to share this with my friends, many of which don't play a lot of games.
Explore a new art style - I wanted to use the jam as an opportunity to challenge myself to make something new.

[subtitle] A wild two days
[paragraph] Going into the jam, I knew that I wanted to make something involving words or letters. Maybe I had been playing
a lot of NYT Spelling Bee lately or something, but it was something I had never done before and it interested me. I rushed
home from work on Friday with a bunch of snacks and waited eagerly for the theme to drop at 6pm.

[paragraph]
Theme: [b]Tiny Creatures[b]

[paragraph]
I still wanted to stick with my word idea, so immediately, having the tiny creatures be letters seemed obvious. I played
around with a couple ideas in my head before coming up with what would basically end up being the final design 
(two days does not leave much space for iteration). Players would run around collecting letters to create a word, and
get scored based on how long / rare the word was.

Art

[paragraph]
I wanted to nail down the art style next. I barely have any art skills, but I thought I could handle drawing 
small cute little 2d creatures that roam around a 3d world like in [link]Paper Mario, https://www.google.com/search?q=paper+mario+gameplay&sca_esv=e06f0df08cc64e4f&udm=2&biw=1149&bih=823&sxsrf=AE3TifPT3uN85ilDz9O1Nbcp6uHtV-IiYA%3A1749399413219&ei=dbdFaKGVDZqIptQP0trjoQc&ved=0ahUKEwjho-HUnOKNAxUahIkEHVLtOHQQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=paper+mario+gameplay&gs_lp=EgNpbWciFHBhcGVyIG1hcmlvIGdhbWVwbGF5MgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgQQABgeMgQQABgeMgQQABgeMgYQABgFGB4yBhAAGAgYHjIGEAAYCBgeMgYQABgIGB5I-QlQhwJYtQlwAXgAkAEAmAFHoAHmBKoBATm4AQPIAQD4AQGYAgqgAocFwgIKEAAYgAQYQxiKBcICBhAAGAcYHsICBxAjGCcYyQLCAgsQABiABBixAxiDAcICDhAAGIAEGLEDGIMBGIoFmAMAiAYBkgcCMTCgB9k2sgcBObgHhQXCBwUwLjUuNcgHHQ&sclient=img[link].
Pretty quickly I had a simple draft for a somewhat cute character, but it felt a little lifeless. I decided to take some
inspiration from [link]Frog's Adventure,https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535670/Frogs_Adventure/[link], a game
with a similar art style that I had played as part of a game club at work. It featured very simple two-frame animation
that worked remarkably well to make the world feel alive.

The art style

[paragraph]
The animation frames I ended up drawing (below) are bad, but they're consistently bad throughout all the assets. 
Sticking to the single, somewhat laughable art style really helped the game feel like a single experience and polished.
I was able to whip up simple 2-frame animations for the player, creatures, and environment in about an hour. Finally, I 
created a simple shader that cycled between the two frames of the animation to save on CPU sprite-switching performance.

The player's idle animation

[paragraph]
The last part of the art style was just to force all the character's to be straight up, but face the camera otherwise.
The camera is quite low to the ground, so this basically prevents the 2d sprites from distorting when looked at from 
different angles. I also added some effects like footsteps and grass shaking as you walked through it.

The final effect

Balance and Design

[paragraph]
Finding a text file of all English words proved harder than I would have thought. Some data sets accepted way too many
nonsense words or abbreviations, and others were missing basic plurals like "volcanoes". The one I eventually settled
on is pretty good, but some people have sent me screenshots of their definitely valid words not being accepted.

[paragraph]
Scoring was fun to implement. I wanted to encourage players to submit long and unusual words, and to reward them as such.
Unfortunately, ranking words based on "rarity" is harder than you would think. In my data set especially, plurals for words
often came up much, much later than there singular counter parts. That lead to very uncommon words often being ranked
as "more common" than more standard words just on the account of them having an 's' or 'ed' at the end. Eventually, 
I pivoted a little bit away from that and based it more on the scrabble-score of the word plus a multiplier for length.

[paragraph]
After playtesting a little, I realized making longer, more complicated words, was the core fun part of the game. I started
each run with two letters that the player had to use - but also gave them the ability to remove letters they collected that
they didn't want. This encouraged creativity as you had to use the letters you were given, but allowed for some mistakes
if you collected a letter you didn't end up needing.

Closing thoughts

[paragraph]
This was SO fun, and I'm so glad I did it. It was the first game I've ever made that my non-gamer friends were able to play.
The intensity of doing it over two days was thrilling. I really loved the art style, and I'd like to explore that style
more in the future with other games.
